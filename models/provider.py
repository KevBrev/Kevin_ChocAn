# Provider Model

# Authorization Function
"""
This will be a boolean function. Checks the ID of the provider. If the provider ID is correct. 
Returns a true statement. 
def give_Auth():
    if authorize function is True
        don't say anything bc the provider was able to log in
    else
        print('You have entered a invalid ID. Try again.')
        return false -> this could then call the authorize function again to ask the
        provider to log in. 
"""

# Member Valid. Member Invalid.
"""
For the valid and invalid functions, it would call the check member_ID function to see if it
returned a true statement or not and send a message accordingly.

def message_ID():
    if check_ID is True
        print("Validated")
    else
        print("Invalidated")
"""

# Provider Directory
"""
Check the function that asks for accessing the directory. If that function returns a true
statement. Then this function will display a JSON file. Maybe?
